title: Working With Brushes

Brushes and Pens are two of the most commonly used objects in Tuval Graphics (TGI) applications. Pens are used to outline graphic objects such as lines and curves; brushes are used to fill the inner areas of graphic objects (for example, filling a rectangle or an ellipse). From this section we will talk about how to create and use various brushes and pens.

We're starting by talking about brushes, brush types, methods and features, and how to create and use them in TGI.

## Understanding and Using Brushes
In TGI, brush-related objects can be defined in two basic categories: Standard and Advanced. The standard defines the general porpose brush classes For example, we can define the Brush, SolidBrush, TextureBrush and Brushes classes as standard brushes; HatchBrush and GradientBrush classes can be evaluated in the advanced category.

The following code simply creates a SolidBrush with a red color. Then draws a rectangle on the screen and fills it with this brush.

  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      var tg = new Tuval.Graphics(300, 200);
      var redBrush = new Tuval.SolidBrush(Tuval.Color.Red);
      var rect = new Tuval.RectangleF(150, 80, 200, 140);
      tg.fillRectangle(redBrush, rect);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
