title: Gradient Brushes

Linear gradient brushes combine two or more colors to create an unlimited range of colors. It is also possible to make custom color transitions using the Blend class. We'll discuss the Blend class in the next sections.

Gradient brushes are essentially brushes with color transitions. It calculates the colors remaining between these two colors from the starting color to the finish color. For example, LinearBradientBrush uses the Linear Interpolation method for calculate intermediate values. This sample uses the lerpColor method of the Graphics class to calculate the color tween values. This method finds the color between two given colors according to the transition value specified in the last parameter.

Fortunately, TGI has a range of gradient brush classes that will save you from interpolating each time. In the next sections we will be talking about these classes.
