---
In the Tuval Framework, the Brush class is an abstract base class, that is, you cannot create an instance of this class without using its derived classes. All available classes are inherited from the Brush class.

Applications often call the fill methods of the Graphics class with the Brush parameter to populate the appropriate TGI shapes (such as ellipses, bows, or polygons) with a specific brush. TGI offers four types of brushes: SolidBrush, HatchBrush, TextureBrush, and GradientBrush. The following figure (created with TGI), brush types and classes are shown.

## Brushes Class
The Brushes class is a class of static members. This class contains more than 140 ready-made SolidBrush objects, each of which represents a specific color (including all standard colors). For example, the Brushes.Pink, Brushes.Red, and Brushes.Green members represent Brush objects in pink, red, and green, respectively.
