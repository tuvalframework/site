title: Drawing Lines
language: en
---
The **drawLine** method draws a line between two points specified by a pair of coordinates. **drawLines** draws a series of lines using a point array.

There are two overloaded method in drawLine. The first argument to all drawLine methods is a Pen object with color, and width properties. The rest of the arguments can change.

*Typescript*
```typescript
public drawLine(Pen, PointF, PointF): void;
public drawLine(Pen, number, number, number, number): void;
```

To draw a line, the application creates a Pen object that defines the color and width before. The following line of code creates a red pen with a width of 1 pixel:
````javascript
var redPen = new Tuval.Pen(Tuval.Color.Red, 1);
````
We then define the starting and ending points of the line:
````javascript
var x1 = 20, y1 = 25;
var x2 = 200, y2 = 100;
````
Finally, we supply pen and points as input to drawLine:
````javascript
tg.drawLine(redPen, x1, y1, x2, y2);
````
The following code example shows how to use different overloaded methods. We create four pens of different color and width. Then we call drawLine (including number points, and PointF structures) with different values to draw four different lines. Three of the lines start at (20, 20).

### Drawing Connected Lines
Sometimes we need to draw more than one connected straight line segment. One way to do this is to call the drawLine method multiple times.

The Graphics class also provides the **drawLines** procedure, which can be used to draw multiple connected lines. This method takes an array of PointF objects:

An application to draw a line using drawLines, first creates a Pen object, then creates a point array, and then calls drawLines. The following code draws three line segments.

                      new Tuval.PointF(200, 200), new Tuval.PointF(20, 20) ];
    tg.drawLines(Tuval.Pens.Red, ptsArray);
