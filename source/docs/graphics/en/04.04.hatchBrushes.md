title: Hatch Brushes
language: en
---
Hatch brush is a brush with pattern style, foreground color, and background color. Patterns are a combination of rectangular lines and lines between lines. The foreground color defines the color of the lines; The background color defines the color between lines.

The HatchBrush class constructor takes HatchStyle as the first parameter and the Color object as the second and third parameter. The second and third Color parameters represent the foreground and background colors respectively. The following code snippet shows two versions of the constructor:

*Typescript*
```typescript
public constructor(style: HatchStyle, color: Color);
public constructor(style: HatchStyle, backgroundColor:Color, foregroundColor:Color);
```
The following code creates a hatch brush with a DashedVertical pattern style, blue background color, and red foreground color:
```typescript
const hatchBrush: HatchBrush = new HatchBrush(HatchStyle.DashedVertical, Color.Blue, Color.Red);
```
We can use this hatch brush to fill rectangular or elliptical graphical shapes. For example, the following line of code fills an ellipse using hatchBrush variable:
```typescript
tg.fillEllipse(hatchBrush, 20, 40, 100, 120);
```
HatchBrush has three class members: BackgroundColor, ForegroundColor, and HatchStyle. BackgroundColor returns the color of the spaces between pattern lines, and ForegroundColor displays the color of the pattern lines. HatchStyle can be one of the members of the HatchStyle enumeration type listed in the following table.
